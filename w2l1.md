**Circuit switching**
- resources RESERVED, which means no statistical multiplexing

**Packet switching**
- resources are NOT RESERVED, and so it uses statistical multiplexing

**Throughput (bitrate)**
Rate at which bits transferred between reader/sender.

**Queueing delays**
Queue will fill up and packets will potentially drop IF the bandwidth for the outgoing throughput is LOWER than the incoming throughput. Essentially, packets cannot leave as fast as they enter, creating a bottleneck.

### Internet protocol stack - layers

**Application**: supporting network applications (FTP, SMTP, HTTP)

**Transport**: process-process data transfer (UDP, TCP)

**Network**: routing of datagrams from source to destination (IP, routing protocols)

**Link**: data transfer between neighbouring networks (ethernet, wifi)

**Physical**: bits "on the wire"
